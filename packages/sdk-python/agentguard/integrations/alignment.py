"""
Alignment helper — call ``/api/v1/alignment/check`` from any agent
loop and, optionally, have the verdict auto-flow into the next
``/check`` so the gateway's Policy DSL can react on the same hop.

This is the framework-agnostic entry point. If your agent runs on
LangChain or CrewAI, prefer the dedicated callbacks
(``integrations.langchain.AlignmentCallback``,
``integrations.crewai.make_alignment_step_callback``) — they
capture the chain-of-thought + tool action for free. Reach for
this helper when:

- You're on a framework we don't ship a callback for (autogen,
  raw OpenAI / Anthropic tool loops, in-house agents).
- You want full control over what counts as "the goal" or "the
  thought chain" for a particular hop.

Quick start::

    from agentguard.integrations.alignment import check

    verdict = check(
        agent_id="my-agent",
        declared_goal="Summarise the customer-feedback survey.",
        thought_chain=[
            "Thought: I need to fetch the survey data first.",
        ],
        proposed_action={
            "tool_name": "execute_sql",
            "arguments": {"query": "SELECT * FROM survey"},
        },
        gateway_url="http://localhost:8080",
    )

    if verdict.get("drifted"):
        # The auditor thinks this tool call doesn't serve the
        # declared goal. Decide locally what to do.
        ...

    # The verdict is also buffered in-process keyed by agent_id;
    # the next /check call for the same agent picks it up under
    # `alignment.*` automatically.

    """POST a chain-of-thought + proposed action to the AEGIS
    alignment auditor.

    Returns the parsed JSON verdict from the gateway, typically
    ``{"score": float, "drifted": bool, "signals": [str, ...],
       "reason": str, "model": str}``.

    Network or auditor errors are surfaced as ``httpx`` exceptions.
    Callers wanting a fail-open posture should catch
    ``httpx.HTTPError`` and treat it as "no verdict."

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent_id
        Stable identifier for the calling agent. Used as the buffer
        key for the closed-loop bridge.
    declared_goal
        Plain-English statement of what the current agent run is
        trying to accomplish. The auditor uses this as the anchor.
    proposed_action
        ``{"tool_name": ..., "arguments": {...}}`` — the tool the
        agent is about to dispatch.
    thought_chain
        Optional list of intermediate reasoning steps in order. If
        omitted, the auditor scores from goal + action alone.
    provider, model
        Optional overrides for the upstream LLM judge. Defaults
        come from the gateway's configured provider.
    record_for_check
        When True (default), the verdict is stashed in the
        closed-loop buffer so the SDK's auto-instrumentation will
        splice it into the next ``/check`` payload for this
        ``agent_id``.
